WireShark-Specific Dissector Language

```lua
wssdl.packet {
  message     : u8();
  definition  : i32();
  done        : utf8z();
  easy        : ipv4();
}
```

## What is this?

wssdl is a domain specific language on top of lua built for the
purpose of expressing easily message dissectors.

## Install

### From the release

Grab the bootstrapped `wssdl.lua` from the [latest release][latest],
and put it in your WireShark Plugin directory
(usually ~/.config/wireshark/plugins or /usr/lib/wireshark/<version>)

### From source

The build toolchain needs lua 5.1 or newer, luarocks and the luafilesystem
module.

Clone this repository, and from the root directory call `make install`
to install it to `~/.config/wireshark/plugins`, or
`make WS_PLUGIN_DIR=/your/path install` to install it to the path of your choice.
